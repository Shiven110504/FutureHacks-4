                        AiGoLearning has over 200 student teachers, who signed up to teach children coding. In this
                        talk, we will show you how a high school (or middle school) student can become a coding
                        instructor, and get involved in activities such as organizing Hackathons, managing classes or
                        writing teacher interview series. In addition, we will cover how high school students can start
                        a club at school and empower themselves with leadership.
